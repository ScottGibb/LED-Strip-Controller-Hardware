# Server Rack Controller Module Based Design

## Summary

The Module Based Design is the second stage in the design process. This design is essentially the veroboard design put on a PCB. The design is split into two different designs, the PCB and the Enclosure. The PCB is designed in KiCad and the enclosure is designed using Fusion 360, the enclosure designs are stored in Thingiverse which is linked below.
