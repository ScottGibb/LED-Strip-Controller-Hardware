# Server Rack Controller Component Based Design

## Summary

The final design stage is the Component Based Design. This design is the most complex design and is the most expensive. The design is split into two different designs, the PCB and the Enclosure. The PCB is designed in KiCad and the enclosure is designed using Fusion 360, the enclosure designs are stored in Thingiverse which is linked below.
